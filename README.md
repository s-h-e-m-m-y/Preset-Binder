# Preset Binder
Preset Binder is a plugin used for BakkesMod

### About
This plugin allows you to bind a BM item mod code to a specific car preset, so BM presets are automatically applied once a preset is swapped. Useful for any player that frequently uses BM presets with items they don't have - so almost everyone :).

### Usage
For each preset slot there can exist, there will be a drop down bar where you can add the item code you wish to bind to that preset. The bar will highlight blue if there is a binding to it and green if it is currently equipped.

### Update Log
v1.0.0 - Release

v1.0.1 - Fixed bug where all 50 preset slots show up on list even if you do not have 50 presets.

v1.1.0 - Removed 'Test' button and added 'Edit' for every binding.
